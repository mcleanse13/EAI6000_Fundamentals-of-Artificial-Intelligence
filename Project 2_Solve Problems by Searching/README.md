Pathfinding with A: Implementing and Visualizing Optimal Maze Solutions in Python

In this project, I explored the A* (A-Star) search algorithm and implemented it in Python to solve pathfinding problems on a grid-based maze. The project focused on understanding how A* balances actual path costs and heuristic estimates to efficiently find the shortest path between a start and an end node. I defined a Node class to represent each position in the maze, including its parent and calculated costs, which allowed me to trace paths from the goal back to the start. Using both simple and complex mazes, I applied the algorithm to find optimal paths and also tested scenarios where no solution exists, demonstrating how A* handles unsolvable problems.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with algorithm design and implementation, including constructing grids, calculating heuristic functions, and managing open and closed lists to track nodes during search. By experimenting with different maze configurations, I was able to see how A* intelligently navigates obstacles while prioritizing nodes with the lowest estimated total cost, and I visualized paths through clear outputs that show the step-by-step progression of the algorithm. This exercise strengthened my understanding of search algorithms and their practical applications in AI, robotics, and problem-solving in constrained environments.
