The function f(n) = g(n) + h(n) combines these values, providing a balance to the actual cost with the estimated remaining cost. This allows the algorithm to prioritize nodes with the lowest f(n) value, and this process is vital because it will consistently select nodes with the minimum f(n). The A* will then efficiently find the shortest path to the goal and reduce unnecessary exploration."

It provides information about each possible step like the position and calculated path costs. The parent attribute is crucial because it links each node to its preceding node, allowing the algorithm to trace the path back from the goal to the starting point once a solution is achieved. This feature also allows for an accurate reconfiguration of the path in reverse, and the position quality gives the nodes precise location in the maze which is necessary for looking at the distances and identifying valid moves."
