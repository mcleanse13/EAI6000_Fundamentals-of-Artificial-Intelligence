# EAI6000_Fundamentals-of-Artificial-Intelligence

Throughout the EAI6000 course, I explored the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning, gaining hands-on experience with supervised learning, model evaluation, natural language processing, and agent perception. Across the course projects, I implemented a variety of machine learning techniques including logistic regression, k-fold and repeated k-fold cross-validation, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. I worked with synthetic classification datasets to evaluate and improve model accuracy, applied pipelines and standardization for consistency, and leveraged GridSearchCV for systematic hyperparameter optimization. Each project emphasized critical aspects of model development, including selecting appropriate algorithms, preprocessing data, and measuring performance metrics to build robust and reliable predictive models.

In addition to machine learning, the course introduced natural language processing and the role of environment and perception in AI agents. I utilized the NLTK library to analyze textual data from the Gutenberg Project, tokenizing words and sentences, examining linguistic structures, and exploring corpora such as Hamlet. Through these projects, I developed a deeper understanding of AI challenges in vision and language, the importance of context and structured data for agent intelligence, and methods for translating raw data into actionable insights. Overall, EAI6000 strengthened both my practical and theoretical knowledge of AI, enabling me to build, evaluate, and refine models while addressing real-world data challenges across diverse domains.
