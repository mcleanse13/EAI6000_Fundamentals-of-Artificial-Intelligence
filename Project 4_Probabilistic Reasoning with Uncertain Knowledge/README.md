In this project, I implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to solve a filtering inference problem involving weather prediction based on umbrella observations. I worked with a predefined state space of sunny, rainy, and foggy days, along with prior, transition, and emission probabilities. Using the Forward Algorithm, I calculated the probability distribution of weather states over time, given a sequence of umbrella observations, allowing me to identify the most likely hidden state at each step. Through this process, I deepened my understanding of how temporal data and probabilistic reasoning can be combined to make predictions in uncertain environments.

I also explored the practical implications of decision theory in rational agent design, considering how observed evidence influences probabilistic predictions and subsequent decisions. By visualizing the evolution of state probabilities over multiple days, I gained insight into the dynamics of HMMs and how observations update beliefs over time. Overall, this project strengthened my ability to implement predictive models for sequential data, apply filtering techniques, and interpret probabilistic outcomes in real-world contexts.
